# VCI-100-Mapping-for-MIXXX
This repository should help anybody who still has a Vestax VCI-100 and wants to use MIXXX without sacrificing the capabilities off this controller.

 Missing:
 - Middle/Top/Side Effect Buttons should light up if in use
 - Effect parameters should be correctly mapped and light up when ON
 - Effect selection should work
 - Effect focus should work (Focused effect gets master controls for volume)
   - A and B should correspond to first effects settings
 - Middle Cue/Headphone-Buttons should indicate headphones in use
 - Light up Eject button if it can be used (loaded track in previewdeck)
   - Should disable loop/hotcue mode altogether to be able to use the buttons
   - Ejecting should also disable the preview mode
 - Sync button should use multicolours if synced/not synced
   - Support Sync lock with key2+sync?
 - Add last effect button for changing selected effect on EffectUnit
 - Make use of multicolors? (may be impossible without firmware update)
 - Cleanup
